    "- Besides the homework-assignments, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We aim to hand-out six projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The project needs to be submitted by uploading this notebook to [Projects/Project 1](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_3381147.html) on eCampus. You do not need to modify the notebooks name before your upload. Your project must be on eCampus by Thursday, 15.05.2025, 11:55pm. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",

    "The data used in this problem set was/is collected by two different satellite missions. Involved are the AMSR-E instrument on the [Aqua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_%28satellite%29) satellite (data from 2002 to 2011) and the AMSR2 instrument on the [GCOM-W](https://suzaku.eorc.jaxa.jp/GCOM_W/) satellite (data from 2013 to-date). The data consist of maps of the concentration of ice in the Arctic collected between 2002 and 2023 with the exception of 2012. All the data were already downloaded and transformed for you to an easy-to-use format from [here](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/start/data-archive/). One of the main issues to work on scientific data with Python is to first read them from various formats into `numpy`-arrays. We will come back to it in class but you do not need to worry about it here.\n",

This is actually a (small) subset of the complete satellite data set, with only two ice maps every month (some are missing though). You should explore yourself the original data if you are interested to work with the full data set. I am very happy to help you with that! Although we only work with a small subset of available ice-maps, we would like to ask you *not* to copy them to your private space within our system but to work with them at their current location. We would like to avoid multiplying 400MB more than 100 times! If you would like to use the data on your own computer, there is a `tar`-archive at `/home/share/Project_2/ice_data_2025.tgz`.\n",

    "Start off by reading in some  map as shown above, and plot it with Matplotlib (look up the `ax.imshow`-function). Note that to get the correct orientation, you will need to call the ``imshow`` command with the ``origin='lower'`` option, which ensures that the (0,0) pixels is on the bottom left, not the top left. You can try and use different colormaps if you like (set by the ``cmap`` option) - see [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) (scroll down on the page) for information on the available colormaps. You can specify a colormap to use with e.g. ``cmap=plt.cm.jet`` (i.e. ``cmap=plt.cm.`` followed by the name of the colormap). Note that you can make figures larger by specifying an explicit `figsize` in `plt.subplots`:\n",

Remember that you can always look at the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) to find example plots for each `matplotlib`-feature. You can also try and remove the tick labels (``100``, ``200``, etc.) since they are not useful - but don't worry if you can't figure out how."

    "**Remarks:** (1) When you explore the data-values, you will notice that they contain numbers from 0 to 100. A value of 50 means that 50% of the area occupied by the corresponding pixel are covered with ice. A value of zero means that the complete pixel is covered with water; (2) Besides the numbers, a good deal of the pixels contains the special value `nan` (not a number). These are areas covered by land. Functions like `imshow` automatically ignore these values and do not produce an error. If you intend to do numerical calculations (`numpy`) with pixels that have a `nan`-value, the result is `nan` again by default. To ignore `nan`-values for building sums etc., you would need to use functions as `np.nansum` instead of `np.sum` etc."

    "We now want to make a plot of the ice concentration over time. Reading in a single map is easy, but since we have more than 350 maps, we do not want to read them all in individually by hand. Write a loop over all the available files, and inside the loop, read in the data to a variable (e.g. ``data``), and also extract the year, month, and day as integer values (e.g. ``year``, ``month``, and ``day``) from the filename. Then, also inside the loop, construct an array ``times`` which is essentially the fractional time in years. You can assume for simplicity that each month has 30 days and each year has 360 days - this will not affect the results later. As an example, in the year 2003, you would put the 1st of January as $2003.00$, the 2nd of January as $2003 + \\frac{1}{360}\\approx 2003.033$ and the 1st of February as $2003 + \\frac{1}{12}\\approx 2003.083$ into the `times`-array. Finally, also compute for each file the total number of pixels that have a value above 50% ice. Put also those values into an array. After the loop, make a plot of the number of pixels with a concentration above 50% against time.\n",
